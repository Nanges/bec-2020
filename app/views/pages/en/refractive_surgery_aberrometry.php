    <h4><strong>WAVE FRONT CUSTOMIZED VISUAL CORRECTION 
      BY ABBEROMETRY OR WAVE FRONT GUIDED CUSTOM LASER, ZYOPTIX<br>
    </strong></h4>
    <p>Our eyes are similar to fingerprints: they have their individual shape with their own characteristics. Customized treatment by aberrometry uses a software allowing treating optic aberrations specific to each eye. The purpose is to enhance quality of vision better than glasses, lens or conventional treatment.</p>

      <span class="gws">Aberrometry</span></p>
    <p>Until 2002, existing diagnostic instruments could detect myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism. They represent 90% of all refractive errors. Higher order aberrations represent the last 10%.</p>
    <p>Aberrometers are new instruments able to measure and treat these higher order aberrations in a personal way specific to each patient.</p>

    <p><strong>Front Wave Analysis:</strong><br>
    Originally used by astro-physicians, this technique is adapted to the treatment of refractive errors.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>	Higher order aberrations are measured by the analysis of the reflected image through an optic grid.</li>
      <li>The wave front diagnosis performed with a non-contact instrument that studies the whole optic system of the eye from the retina to the cornea.</li>
      <li>      Measurements of aberrations are combined to an analysis of the anterior and posterior corneal topography by the Orbscan.</li>
      <li>      Parameters measured by the Aberrometer are transferred to a disk. These data allow a computer-assisted treatment of common refractive errors (myopia and astigmatism) and higher order aberrations. This technique also prevents induced laser aberrations.</li>
      <li>	Advantages of a customized treatment by aberrometry are:
        <ul>
          <li>	Customized treatment according to aberrations for each eye.</li>
          <li>Enhancement of the best postoperative visual acuity sometimes up to more than 100%.</li>
          <li> Enhancement of night and sometimes day quality of vision compared to conventional treatment.</li>
          <li>Fewer risk of decrease of best corrected visual acuity.</li>
          <li>Better visual stability and fewer risk of re-treatment.</li>
          <li>Ability to treat severe ametropia not treatable until now by classic techniques, even with a moderate corneal thickness or a large pupil diameter at night. <br>
            </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <p align="center"><img src="../images/aberration.jpg" alt="Aberrations de l'oeil" width="400" height="216"></p>
    </ul>
    <p align="left"> 
    Customized treatment by aberrometry is essentially indicated for patients with significant higher order aberrations and large pupil diameter measured preoperatively. In these cases, post-operative results are statistically significantly better than with conventional treatment.</p>
