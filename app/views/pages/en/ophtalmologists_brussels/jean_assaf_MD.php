          <li>	<strong>Refractive surgery</strong>: Doctor Assaf began refractive surgery in Belgium with Laser EXCIMER AT university hospital St-Pierre in 1993 (<a href="../refractive_surgery_radial_keratotomy.html">radial keratotomy</a>, Laser Excimer, <a href="../refractive_surgery_PRK.html">PRK</a>, Phakic IOL,...).<br>
            <br>
  He began <a href="../refractive_surgery_lasik.html">Lasik</a> in Paris in early 1995. At almost the beginning of this technique. He reported in 2003 the results of the treatment by <a href="../refractive_surgery_aberrometry.html">aberrometry</a> and customized treatment with the platform Zyoptics Bausch &amp; Lomb. <br>
  <br>
  He began customized and aberrometry treatment to improve visual quality after refractive surgery. He participated to the first European studies about customized Lasik and aberrometry. <br>
  <br>
            He communicated his results during international meetings about customized Lasik, aberrometry and treatment of high myopia with Lasik and with <a href="../intra-ocular_lenses_phakic.html">phakic intraocular lenses</a>. <br>
            <br>
            Since 2003, Doctor Assaf is using the technique of ultra-thin Lasik with thin flap (90 to 110 µ), with specific device of the hansatom zerocompression head.<br>
            <br>
            Since 2004, Doctor Assaf is exercising in his private center the Brussels Eye Center where he performs refractive surgery with the Wavelight Allegretto Laser platform. Since 1994, he is using <a href="../intra-ocular_lenses_artisan.html">ARTISAN</a> and <a href="../intra-ocular_lenses_artiflex.html">ARTIFLEX</a> phakic and intraocular lenses for high myopia. And since 2005, he is using the <a href="../intra-ocular_lenses_visian-ICL.html">VISIAN ICL</a> monofocal and toric for the correction of high myopia and hyperopia combined with astigmatism.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>	Doctor Assaf is performing phacoemulsification technique for <a href="../cataract_surgery.html">cataract surgery</a> with topical anaesthesia using drops since 1994. He communicated his clinical results in national and international meetings.<br>
            <br>
            He began in 2005 the clinical application and the implantation of multifocal ALCON <a href="../pseudo-accomodative_implants_restor.html">RESTOR</a> as part of cataract surgery. The ALCON RESTOR allows far and near vision and the new model RESTOR AD1 (2008) allows also intermediate vision.<br>
            <br>
            Since 2007 he is performing phacoemulsification technique with micro-incision without suture combined with an implantation of multifocal intraocular lenses correcting <a href="../myopia.html">myopia</a>, <a href="../hyperopia.html">hyperopia</a> and <a href="../astigmatism.html">astigmatism</a> with <a href="../presbyopia.html">presbyopia</a>. <br>
            <br>
            Doctor Assaf is always <a href="../eye_surgery_technology.html">using last techniques and last technologies</a> with the best devices and the last generation of intraocular lenses. <br>
            He is applying the most efficient surgical techniques for refractive surgery and cataract surgery and is always choosing <a href="../eye_diseases.html">the best indication</a> for the specific case of each patient.<br>
