    <h2 align="center"><strong>OTHER DISEASES OF THE EYES</strong></h2>
    <p><br>
      <strong>GLAUCOMA CHRONIC OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA</strong><br>
      Syndrome that includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>	High intra-ocular pressure (IOP)</li>
      <li>Optic nerve damage</li>
      <li>Alteration of the visual field </li>
    </ul>
    <p>      <strong>ACUTE ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA</strong><br>
    Acute glaucoma occurs when the internal fluid drainage system in the eye is suddenly blocked and results in a very high IOP. The eye becomes painful with severe aching, blurred vision and can cause nausea and vomiting.</p>
    <p>      <strong>Surgical treatment</strong><br>
    Surgical treatment is indicated when local or oral treatment is insufficient.</p>
    <ul><li>	YAG Laser treatment allows performing a small opening in the iris that facilitates circulation of aqueous humour. The treatment is painless under local anaesthesia by eye drops.<br>  
        <br>
    </li>
      <li>Trabeculectomy: if high IOP persists, a scleral flap is performed to facilitate evacuation of the aqueous humour to the outside of the eye. This surgery is performed under local anaesthesia.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
