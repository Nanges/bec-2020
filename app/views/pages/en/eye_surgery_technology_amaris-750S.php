    <h2>Schwind Amaris 750 S - 1050 hz ET</h2>
    <p><img src="../images/amaris_750S/amaris_pantherFront.jpg"></p>
    <h4>Minimum treatment time</h4>
    <p> The SCHWIND AMARIS 750S - 1050 hz ET works two to three times
      faster than other laser systems. 750 tiny light flashes
      per second shape the corneal surface. It is extremely
      fast and corrects one dioptre of myopia within
      1.5 seconds, and eight dioptres are ablated within
      13 seconds.</p>
    <h4>Automatic Fluence Level Adjustment</h4>
    <p> In order to perfectly combine speed and precision, the
      SCHWIND AMARIS 750S - 1050 hz ET is equipped – besides a 750 Hz
      pulse frequency – with two energy levels. At first, the
      SCHWIND AMARIS 750S - 1050 hz ET uses a high energy level and
      rapidly ablates around 80 percent of the tissue to be
      removed – like a fast yacht quickly heading for the safe
      harbour. How long the powerful beams are applied
      depends on your individual refractive error and is continuously
      checked by the software during the treatment.
      Like a small sport boat then exactly navigates to a
      narrow landing, a gentler beam ablates the remaining
      20 percent, thus assuring an especially smooth surface
      and perfect vision.
    </p><h4>Eye tracking in six dimensions</h4>
    <p> The eyes can involuntarily move in all directions for
      milliseconds while fixating on the laser light. The
      SCHWIND AMARIS 750S - 1050 hz ET monitors the position
      of the eye with approximately 1050 measurements per
      second and thereby compensates any deviation up to
      the sixth dimension.</p>
    <p> Imagine your eyeball being a buoy in the sea: When the sea
      is calm, the buoy shifts from the left to the right or forward
      and backward. In swell, however, the buoy tilts to the side.
      Furthermore, a buoy also turns around its anchorage
      or moves upward and downward. In the same manner,
      your eyeball can roll (rotation), rotate around its own
      axis (cyclotorsion) or move up and down along the z-axis.
      The eye tracker of the SCHWIND AMARIS 750S - 1050 hz ET detects
      all these eye movements and compensates them. With
      cyclotorsion control, the compensation occurs statically,
      between the sitting and lying positions of the patient,
      and dynamically during the laser treatment.</p>
    <h4>Permanent measurement of corneal thickness</h4>
    <p> Similar to a diver orientating himself in water with his
      depth gauge, your doctor is permanently informed through
      the online pachymetry of the SCHWIND AMARIS 750S - 1050 hz ET.
      This system measures the changes of corneal thickness
      in real time and displays them on the treatment screen.
      Thus, your doctor knows at every point in time how
      much tissue he has already ablated and how thick the
      remaining cornea still is.</p>
    <h4> Exceptionally fine laser beam</h4>
    <p> The laser beams of the SCHWIND AMARIS 750S - 1050 hz ET have
      an exceptionally small diameter of only 0.54 millimetres
      and are thus significantly smaller than others. Further-more they have a special shape. Your cornea becomes
      especially smooth with this fine beam.</p>
    <h4> Constant microclimate</h4>
    <p> With the SCHWIND AMARIS 750S - 1050 hz ET, two specially formed
      nozzles ensure a directed, fine airflow that creates a
      stable microclimate across the cornea. The climatic
      conditions remain constant, preventing the cornea from
      drying out.</p>
    <h4> Unique thermal control</h4>
    <p> The SCHWIND AMARIS 750S - 1050 hz ET is equipped with a unique
      thermal control system. Even at high ablation speed the
      corneal tissue is effectively preserved. The laser pulses
      are temporally and spatially sorted, which gives the
      individual position on the cornea sufficient time to cool
      off. Following pulses can thereby approach an already
      cooled position faster.</p>
    <h4> Clinical results</h4>
    <p> A multitude of international clinical studies have documented
      the excellent treatment quality with SCHWIND
      AMARIS technology. Visual acuity of 100 percent or better
      was achieved in nearly all cases.</p>
    <p> A high percentage of treated patients could see better than
      before with glasses or contact lenses.
      The study results also show improved contrast vision.</p>
