    <p align="left">Implants used in lens and <a href="cataract_surgery.html">cataract surgery</a> to allow far and near vision without glasses.</p>
    <p align="left"> <strong>1. RESTOR</strong><br>
      <a href="ophtalmologists_brussels/jean_assaf_MD.html">Dr. Assaf</a> started in 2005 the use and evaluation of the new RESTOR implant from Alcon Labs, which is approved by FDA (Food and Drug Administration - USA).</p>

    <p align="left">RESTOR allows a far, intermediate and near vision. With this technology, 90% of patients benefit of vision without glasses. Restor is combined to UV filter and Blue light.</p>

    <p align="left"><strong>Two models of RESTOR are available :</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>	RESTOR AD3: (with an addition of +4D allowing a near reading vision at 31 cm without glasses). It’s the first model allowing far and near vision at 30 cm and the intermediate vision is weak.  It’s the first model of Alcon Restor.</li>
      <li>	RESTOR AD1: (with an addition of +3D allowing a near reading vision at 40 cm without glasses). Intermediate vision is better. It’s the last model of Alcon Restor. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Restor lens allows patients to be independent of glasses for far, intermediate and near vision during 85 % of the time. Wearing glasses for near vision is needed in rare cases, especially in low and dim light. Restor AD1 + 3D are the last models of RESTOR.</p>
    <p>It allows more comfortable intermediate vision reading without correction. Glasses for small characters for near reading at near distances are necessarily in few cases.</p>
