<h2 class='text-center'>REFRACTIVE SURGERY</h2>
<h3 class='fs-12'>S.M.I.L.E (SMall Incision Lenticule Extraction)</h3>

<p>Is a technic using a Femto Second laser system, using high precision and speed to reshape the
cornea.</p>
<p>The laser creates a small lense shaped piece of corneal tissue known as lenticule inside the
cornea.</p>
<p>The laser time of the surgery is about 25 seconds. Then, the surgeon removes the lenticule,
across a small incision at the front part of the eye. This reshapes the corneal and corrects the
refractive errors.</p>
<p>SMILE is indicated in the case of treatment of myopia and low astigmatism.</p>

<h4 class='fs-12'>BENEFITS</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Minimally invasive</li>
	<li>The procedure is performed with a 2-4 mm wide incision on the surface of the eye.</li>
	<li>Less post-operative dryness</li>
</ul>

<h4 class='fs-12'>DISADVANTAGES</h4>
<ul>
	<li>SMILE is not yet able to treat hyperopia and high astigmatism.</li>
	<li>The vision recovery is slower than Lasik. It takes several days to get a 20/20 vision, while with
Lasik a 20/20 vision is obtained the following day after the surgery.</li>
	<li>SMILE needs more anti inflammatory treatment.</li>
	<li>The retreatment of over or under correction after SMILE is more complicated than Lasik.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class='fs-12'>COMPLICATIONS</h4>
<p>The complications are the same than other refractive surgeries (infections, night vision
problemsâ€¦) excluding flap dislocation or folds.</p>
